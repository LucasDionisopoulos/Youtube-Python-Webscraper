# Trending YouTube Video Scraper

Crediting code from [MitchelJY](https://github.com/mitchelljy/Trending-YouTube-Scraper), I used this code to pull data on the top 200 trending videos in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Mexico, France, Germany, and Brazil.

We then compiled this into one file and removed duplicate videos before creating the 'subcount_scraper', which was able to pull relevant data on nearly 1,000 unique accounts that created these videos to conduct statistical analysis to better determine what makes a popular YouTube video.
